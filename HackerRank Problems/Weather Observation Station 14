select cast (round (max (lat_n) ,4) as decimal (10,4))
from station 
where lat_n <137.23455

/*  note :
When you ROUND() with T-SQL, it leaves trailing 0’s after the rounded number.
e.g. 120.02 vs 120.020000 where the latter answer is not correct.
He casts it as a DECIMAL(10,2) because the “2” will ensure that there will only be 2 digits after the decimal point.
